// FAMILY LINK PROTOCOL (v0.2.0, P4 item k) — one design shared by all
// three bars (MeterBar / TickerBar / SessionBar), copied per repo with
// only the namespace changed. The TRANSPORT is a small named
// shared-memory block (app/Source/BarLink.h, Windows; honest stub
// elsewhere). Everything DECIDED is pure and lives here:
//
//  - SNAP: when a linked drag ends, a bar whose edge sits within
//    kSnapPx of a linked peer's edge aligns to it exactly.
//  - FOLLOW: while a linked peer is being dragged, followers move by
//    the leader's delta from the drag-session start (offsets and
//    sizes preserved — groupDockRect handles the docked case).
//  - GROUP DOCK: a follower whose linked peer is reserve-docked at
//    an edge stacks against the peer's free side AND aligns to the
//    peer on the cross axis (left edges aligned when stacked
//    vertically, top edges when stacked horizontally — v0.2.1: the
//    v0.2.0 geometry moved the follower along the dock axis only, so
//    a group stacked under a peer that had been moved sideways kept
//    its own x and no longer sat under the peer), so top/bottom
//    docking treats the linked group as one bar.
//  - SHARED BACKGROUND: each slot carries a bgSeq-stamped background
//    (family style ordinal + opacity); the group PARENT's background
//    is adopted by the others. Since BLK6 the parent is the FIRST
//    bar to turn its Link on in the group (first-clicked-wins,
//    Jackson's stated semantics 2026-11-01): every slot carries the
//    linkSeq it claimed from the shared counter when its link
//    turned on, and the parent is the live linked member with the
//    smallest linkSeq (ties — an unclaimed 0 or a counter reset —
//    break by lowest appId, so every member computes the same
//    parent from the same block). The client publishes only on
//    change, so adoption cannot ping-pong.
//
// A drag session is "live" while its stamp is fresher than
// kLeaderStaleMs; staleness — never a stuck flag — ends it.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// BACKGROUND SYNC DECISIONS (v0.2.1) — the publish/adopt rules for the
// shared background, as pure functions over a per-client state block.
// They live here (not in the JUCE client) so the whole propagation
// policy is unit-tested; the client only moves bytes and applies the
// answers. Field background for this extraction: the v0.2.0 client
// kept these rules inline and untested, and the field test showed
// background changes not propagating. The rules below fix the three
// defects that review of the v0.2.0 client proved from the code:
//
//  1. ECHO: a follower that adopted a peer's background then
//     re-published those same values as its OWN change (its publish
//     gate compared against its pre-adoption values), bumping its
//     bgSeq and making the originator adopt its own values back.
//     Rule: adopted values ARE the adopter's published values
//     (bgAdoption records them in `published*`), so the publish gate
//     stays shut for them.
//  2. SEQ INFLATION: the settings feed force-published on EVERY
//     settings interaction, bumping bgSeq even when the background
//     had not changed. Rule: publishing is gated on an actual value
//     change (bgIsLocalChange) — nothing else may bump bgSeq.
//  3. LAST-WRITER bookkeeping across several peers changing at once:
//     every unseen live+linked peer seq is marked seen in one scan,
//     and the LAST such peer in slot order supplies the values (the
//     v0.2.0 loop's effective outcome, now pinned by tests).
//
//  4. NO PARENT (link-parent ownership): the rules above are
//     SYMMETRIC — any bar's packet can be adopted by any other.
//     Combined with the client's link-join re-stamp (a bar turning
//     its link on force-republishes its own pre-link background
//     under a fresh bgSeq), two bars linking up each adopted the
//     OTHER's stale background — a swap, not an inheritance — and
//     the bar Jackson set the shared background on never became
//     the authority. His standing rule is link-PARENT ownership:
//     when bars are linked, the parent applies the visual settings
//     to the others. Rule: adoption flows DOWNHILL ONLY from the
//     group parent. A follower's own local change still publishes
//     (its packet becomes the authority if it ever becomes the
//     parent), but no follower packet is ever adopted while a
//     parent is live.
//
//  5. WRONG PARENT + NO PARENT-LINK TRIGGER (BLK6, the 2026-11-01
//     evening field test): the first parent rule picked the parent
//     by FIXED slot order (lowest appId), so the parent was whoever
//     owned the lowest slot — not the bar Jackson linked first,
//     which is the semantics he stated live: "click the button for
//     the link first would be ideally what you would want the
//     background to change to." Adoption was also purely bgSeq-
//     gated: nothing re-triggered it when the PARENT's link event
//     was the one that completed the group. Rule: the parent is
//     the live linked member with the smallest linkSeq (first-
//     clicked wins); adoption re-fires whenever the parent's
//     identity OR its linkSeq changes (adoptedFrom /
//     adoptedLinkSeq), not only when its bgSeq advances — so a
//     follower adopts the standing packet when the parent's packet
//     first appears in the block, when parenthood hands off after
//     the parent unlinks (the earliest-linked remaining member
//     takes over), and never from a late joiner (largest linkSeq,
//     never the parent while an earlier member is live). A parent
//     that unlinks and relinks claims a NEW linkSeq and returns
//     as a late joiner.
//
//  6. ONE-SHOT ADOPTION (v0.6.8, Jackson's 2026-11-02 19:38 field
//     report — "the background style and opacity does not line up
//     when linking" — filed AFTER the v0.6.6/BLK6 fixes shipped):
//     defects 4+5 made adoption fire at join and on parent seq /
//     identity / linkSeq changes, but nothing re-checked it after
//     that. A follower that changed its OWN background while
//     linked recorded those values as its published values (the
//     client's publish path) and then kept them indefinitely: the
//     parent's seq had not moved and its identity had not changed,
//     so the adoption gate stayed shut and the follower's style /
//     opacity / effect diverged from the parent's until the parent
//     happened to change something. Rule: adoption is CONTINUOUS
//     — whenever this app's published values differ from the
//     parent's standing packet, the packet is (re-)adopted,
//     whatever the seq bookkeeping says. The parent governs for
//     the whole link, not just at join.

// COMBINATION of the linked bars' screen rects (the group rect the
// client computes), not by each bar alone. The particle model
// stays in unit space; this pure map converts a unit field point
// into the bar's own render-cache pixels — the field spans the
